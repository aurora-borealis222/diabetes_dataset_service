# Diabetes prediction dataset service
The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. 

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are the primary source of data for the Diabetes Prediction dataset. The data can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset/data).
